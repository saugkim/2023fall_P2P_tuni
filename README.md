# 2023fall_P2P_tuni

## Laboratory assignment

In Fall 2023, official method of completing the assignment is self-study (remote).

In order to pass the assignment, you must complete one of the following options:

1. Set up the blockchain and complete the tasks on your own, and submit the post-lab report. (Groups of 1-2 students)

2. Complete the exercise by using computers in the campus lab (sign-up below on this page, to be published), and submit the post-lab report. (Groups of 1-2 students; very limited capacity)
 

Official due date for submitting reports is 17.12.2023 at 23:59. 

Late reports are accepted until the third exam date. However:
  - Assistant will not provide any help after the official due date. 
  - Checking of reports may take longer than usual.
  - No feedback is given for late reports.
 

If you wish to complete the lab at home:

Practically any environment where you can install Python, the necessary modules, and access the web interface can be used. You need Python (at least 3.6) and some additional Python modules installed. Wireshark is optional, but might help. Missing modules can be installed using pip from the command line: pip install ed25519 Crypto pycryptodome sortedcontainers flask flask-cors

On Windows, you may need to install C++ Build Tools, which is why it is recommended to use some other option.
The blockchain implementation used in the assignment is open source and is available here [https://github.com/adilmoujahid/blockchain-python-tutorial].

You can run all nodes on one PC by using different port numbers on each one. You can also use 2 PCs on your home network. Make sure you use the instructions intended for the remote version.

We expect that you know how to install programs, set up IP addresses and do basic operations in the terminal.  
Due to scarce resources, only limited support will be available for setting up the lab environment. We expect to be mainly answering questions about the lab itself and clarifying the instructions.
